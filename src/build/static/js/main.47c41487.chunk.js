There have been a few isolated \n            cases, such as ESPN's coverage of table tennis circa 1980, and \n            we had some TV exposure in the early 1990s due to Dan Seemiller's \n            efforts. But these are the exceptions. In general, table tennis \n            doesn't get nearly as much TV exposure as other, seemingly lesser \n            sports. The same thing applies to the various major online venues as well. \n            But long ago I realized why. I'm going to explain with a seemingly \n            non-related item - the history of Star Trek.",'In 1964, Gene Roddenberry went to Desilu Productions with the \n            idea for Star Trek. It was well-thought out, but was so revolutionary \n            that it was turned down by CBS and NBC. The board of Desilu also voted \n            against producing it - but they were overruled by their owner, \n            Lucille Ball, of "I Love Lucy" fame. Ball liked the idea and championed it, \n            and made Star Trek happen. If not for her, there would be no Star Trek.\n             ','How does this relate to table tennis? Well, look at all those sports and "sports" that get exposure on TV. Also look at all the bad movies and TV shows that get made. Why does that happen? Because of each of them had a "champion" who made it happen. It means that no matter what you do, there is an element of luck in getting something produced on TV.',"However - and this is the BIG HOWEVER - there's a saying in sports that champions make their own luck. What that means when it comes to getting on TV is two-fold. (And now I'm going to cleverly and completely change the meaning of the word \"champion.\") First, you have to find your champion. Second, you have to sell your champion. In the case of Star Trek, Roddenberry went to multiple networks and studios in search of a champion, and found one in Lucille Ball. Then he was able to sell her on the idea. She championed its production, and the result is history."]},{name:"lob",title:"How to Lob Like a Pro",content:["We\u2019ve all seen those crazy lob rallies. A player is defending for their life, far away from the table, popping the ball up high in the air, only to have it smashed back at them.","It sure does look impressive and although it might appear a little ridiculous and counter-intuitive to the untrained eye, lobbing is a great form of defence when you are forced away from the table. And it is much easier to learn than you would think!","I remember trying out lobs for the first time. I wasn\u2019t great by any means, but I was surprised by the fact that most of my lobs were landing on the table.","For intermediate players and above, lobs are certainly performable. It just takes a bit of time and adjustment to find your range. I expect after 15 minutes most intermediate and above players should be able to perform lobs with a fair degree of success.","But then comes the difficult part, your pesky opponent. It\u2019s no good just getting the ball on your opponent\u2019s side of the table, you need to limit their attacking options. To lob \u201clike a pro\u201d there are four key components you need to get right."]},{name:"serve",title:"3 Core Table Tennis Serves",content:["1. The Chop Serve - Kicking things off we\u2019ve got the chop serve. It is an easy serve to perform and often the safest. Given that the chop imparts solely backspin, it is the easiest serve to keep short. This prevents your opponent from opening up with loops. What\u2019s more, if you\u2019re able to produce good levels of backspin many players will be reluctant to play flick returns as well. This means you will be fed a push return.","2. The Pendulum Serve - The next essential serve you need to be comfortable using is the pendulum. Perhaps the most popular serve today, it introduces sidespin into the equation. Much like the chop serve, it is very easy to perform and certainly can be tricky to return if performed effectively.","3. The reverse pendulum/shovel serve is certainly the hardest to perform out of the three table tennis serves. Nonetheless, it is just as important. Either of these serves account for what you are lacking in the chop and pendulum \u2013 sidespin which encourages the ball to your forehand. ","I can pretty much say I\u2019ve found specific weaknesses for players in every service combination: short heavy topspin shovels, long backspin pendulums, medium-long chops, and the list goes on."]},{name:"physical",title:"Physical Training is Important",content:["As far as competitive sports go, table tennis is not ranked too highly on the list of ones that are physically demanding. Because of this, people often think that outside physical training - i.e. - working out - is not necessary to be a decent player. To a certain extent, that is true. To be a decent table tennis player, you don't have to spend a lot of time working out at the gym or home gym.","To be a great table tennis player, though, will require you to put in some time and effort at the gym.","When playing on my table tennis team, our coach required us to take one mandatory group session at the gym each week. At the time, some of the players thought it was a useless requirement, but as I've grown older, I've come to understand that one day a week in the gym actually wasn't enough time.","Because I was never one to work out often, I have a weak core. This is actually a huge detriment for a serious table tennis player. Without a strong core, you cannot achieve the same level of power and endurance as other players who work out regularly.","It is sometimes hard to work gym time into an already packed schedule of practices balanced against everyday responsibilities, but if you want to be truly exceptional, then you have to make the time."]}],k=function(){return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,"Articles"),o.a.createElement(w,{articles:E}))},T=n(6),I=n.n(T),x=n(9),j=n(11),A=function(e){var t=e.comments;return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Comments:"),t.map(function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"comment",key:t},o.a.createElement("h4",null,e.username),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.text))}))},S=function(e){var t=e.articleName,n=e.upvotes,a=e.setArticleInfo,r=function(){var e=Object(x.a)(I.a.mark(function e(){var n,o;return I.a.wrap(function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t,"/upvote"),{method:"post"});case 2:return n=e.sent,e.next=5,n.json();case 5:o=e.sent,a(o);case 7:case"end":return e.stop()}},e)}));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return o.a.createElement("div",{id:"upvotes-section"},o.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return r()}},"Add Upvote"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"This post has been upvoted ",n," times"))},O=function(e){var t=e.articleName,n=e.setArticleInfo,r=Object(a.useState)(""),s=Object(j.a)(r,2),i=s[0],l=s[1],c=Object(a.useState)(""),u=Object(j.a)(c,2),m=u[0],h=u[1],p=function(){var e=Object(x.a)(I.a.mark(function e(){var a,o;return I.a.wrap(function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t,"/add-comment"),{method:"post",body:JSON.stringify({username:i,text:m}),headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json"}});case 2:return a=e.sent,e.next=5,a.json();case 5:o=e.sent,n(o),l(""),h("");case 9:case"end":return e.stop()}},e)}));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return o.a.createElement("div",{id:"add-comment-form"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Add a Comment"),o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:",o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",value:i,onChange:function(e){return l(e.target.value)}})),o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:",o.a.createElement("textarea",{rows:"4",cols:"50",value:m,onChange:function(e){return h(e.target.value)}})),o.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return p()}},"Add Comment"))},B=function(){return o.a.createElement("h1",null,"404: Page Not Found")},C=function(e){var t=e.match.params.name,n=E.find(function(e){return e.name===t}),r=Object(a.useState)({upvotes:0,comments:[]}),s=Object(j.a)(r,2),i=s[0],l=s[1];if(Object(a.useEffect)(function(){!function(){var e=Object(x.a)(I.a.mark(function e(){var n,a;return I.a.wrap(function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(t));case 2:return n=e.sent,e.next=5,n.json();case 5:a=e.sent,l(a);case 7:case"end":return e.stop()}},e)}));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}()()},[t]),!n)return o.a.createElement(B,null);var c=E.filter(function(e){return e.name!==t});return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h1",null,n.title),o.a.createElement(S,{articleName:t,upvotes:i.upvotes,setArticleInfo:l}),n.content.map(function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("p",{key:t},e)}),o.a.createElement(A,{comments:i.comments}),o.a.createElement(O,{articleName:t,setArticleInfo:l}),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Other Articles:"),o.a.createElement(w,{articles:c}))},N=function(){return o.a.createElement("nav",null,o.a.createElement("ul",null,o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/"},"Home")),o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/about"},"About")),o.a.createElement("li",null,o.a.createElement(h.b,{to:"/articles-list"},"Articles"))))},W=(n(40),function(e){function t(){return Object(i.a)(this,t),Object(c.a)(this,Object(u.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(m.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement(h.a,null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(N,null),o.a.createElement("div",{id:"page-body"},o.a.createElement(p.c,null,o.a.createElement(p.a,{path:"/",component:y,exact:!0}),o.a.createElement(p.a,{path:"/about",component:v}),o.a.createElement(p.a,{path:"/articles-list",component:k}),o.a.createElement(p.a,{path:"/article/:name",component:C}),o.a.createElement(p.a,{component:B})))))}}]),t}(a.Component));Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));s.a.render(o.a.createElement(W,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[26,1,2]]]);
